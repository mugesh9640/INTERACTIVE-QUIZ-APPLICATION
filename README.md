DESCRIPTION: The Frontend Quiz Application is a fully responsive, interactive, and user-friendly web-based quiz platform built entirely using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is designed to help users test and enhance their knowledge of frontend development technologies including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other foundational web topics. This project demonstrates key frontend concepts like DOM manipulation, event handling, timers, and local storage, making it an excellent educational tool as well as a demonstration of frontend engineering capabilities.

The quiz app presents users with a series of multiple-choice questions. Each question includes four answer options, only one of which is correct. Upon selecting an answer, the user immediately receives instant visual feedbackâ€”the correct option is highlighted in green, while incorrect ones turn red. If the user selects the correct answer, they are rewarded with a score increment. If the user does not make a selection within the given 10-second timer, the question is automatically marked as "Not Answered" and is treated as incorrect.The app also features a progress bar that visually represents how far the user has progressed through the quiz. Additionally, a question counter is displayed in the top-right corner, showing the current question number out of the total (e.g., 4/15), which enhances navigation and orientation.One unique feature of this quiz app is that it stores the high score locally using localStorage. This allows users to track their personal bests across sessions, promoting repeat usage and self-improvement.

Each question comes with a countdown timer (default: 10 seconds), which adds a time-based challenge to the quiz. If the timer expires before the user selects an answer, the app records the attempt as a missed question, automatically logs it as incorrect, and moves to the next question. This feature ensures that users remain actively engaged throughout the quiz experience.After completing the quiz, users are presented with a detailed score summary. This includes the total score,the highest score ever achieved (stored using localStorage),a review section listing all the questions, user's selected answers, and the correct answers.The review section uses visual cues such as colored text to distinguish between correct and incorrect answers. Unanswered questions are clearly labeled as "Not Answered." Additionally, special HTML characters (e.g., <a>, <img>, <script>) are safely escaped and displayed properly in the review section using a custom escapeHTML() function to prevent rendering issues.

The interface is minimalist, clean, and mobile-responsive. Buttons are styled for accessibility and hover effects are included to enhance interactivity. Visual consistency is maintained using reusable CSS classes and intuitive layout structure. The app is fully responsive and adapts well to both desktop and mobile screens.
